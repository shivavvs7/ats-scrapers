# jobhive

> **The open dataset and toolkit for global job market data.**
> 3.3M+ live jobs from 400 000+ companies, scraped directly from the ATS platforms where companies actually post. No LinkedIn, no reposts, no recruiters.

No API key, no auth, no rate limits. The dataset refreshes every 24 hours.

## Why jobhive

Most job aggregators scrape LinkedIn and Indeed — both full of duplicates,
ghost listings, and reposts. **jobhive goes one layer down**: directly to
the ATS platforms (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday, BambooHR…) where
companies actually post.

- **Single source of truth** — every row comes from the company's own
  ATS, so titles, locations, and salaries are accurate.
- **No duplicates** — one ATS posting = one row.
- **Structured salary** when the ATS exposes it (Ashby, Greenhouse Pay
  Transparency, Lever salaryRange, etc.).
- **MIT licensed, fully open** — fork the dataset, fork the scrapers.

`https://storage.stapply.ai/jobhive/v1/manifest.json` — verify any time
with `jobhive list-ats`.

## Install

```bash
pip install jobhive
```

Optional extras:

```bash
pip install "jobhive[parquet]"     # faster downloads via Apache Parquet
pip install "jobhive[scrapers]"    # build your own pipeline
pip install "jobhive[all]"
```

## Two ways to use it

### 1. Query the public dataset

```python
from jobhive import search

# Free-text title + location + remote filter
df = search(query="rust", location="Berlin", remote=True, salary_min=80_000)

# Restrict to one ATS slice (smaller download)
df = search(query="data engineer", ats="ashby")

# Pandas all the way down
df.groupby("company").size().sort_values(ascending=False).head(20)
```

Every row carries:

```
url, title, company, ats_type, ats_id,
location, is_remote, lat, lon,
salary_min, salary_max, salary_currency, salary_period, salary_summary,
employment_type, commitment, experience, department, team,
description, posted_at, fetched_at, requisition_id, apply_url, raw
```

Optional fields are `None` when the source ATS doesn't expose them.
``raw`` keeps any provider-specific fields the canonical schema doesn't
represent — Greenhouse `metadata`, Workday `bulletFields`, etc.

### 2. Scrape your own companies

```python
from jobhive.scrapers import GreenhouseScraper, LeverScraper, AshbyScraper

jobs = GreenhouseScraper("anthropic").fetch()    # → list[Job]
jobs = LeverScraper("palantir").fetch()
jobs = AshbyScraper("openai").fetch()
```

Or pick by name:

```python
from jobhive.scrapers import get_scraper

scraper = get_scraper("ashby", "openai")
```

## Scrapers

**Multi-tenant ATS** (pass the company's slug on that ATS):

`Greenhouse`, `Lever`, `Ashby`, `SmartRecruiters`, `Workable`,
`Rippling`, `Personio`, `Gem`, `JoinCom`, `iCIMS`, `JazzHR`, `Breezy`,
`Teamtailor`, `Pinpoint`, `BambooHR`, `Cornerstone`, `Recruitee`,
`Recruiterbox`, `Eightfold`, `Avature`, `Phenom`, `Workday`, `Oracle`,
`SuccessFactors`, `Taleo`, `Mercor`.

**Custom big-tech APIs** (single-tenant, slug ignored): `Amazon`,
`Apple`, `Google`, `TikTok`, `Uber`.

**National public-sector aggregators**: `Bundesagentur` (DE),
`Arbetsformedlingen` (SE), `Eures` (EU/EEA-wide).

**Hybrid jobboards**: `WelcomeToTheJungle`.

A few scrapers (`Tesla`, `Meta`) need a real browser session and ship as
placeholders pending the optional browser backend in 0.2.

## CLI

```bash
jobhive search "platform engineer" --location Paris --limit 20
jobhive scrape ashby openai
jobhive list-ats
```

## Contributing

**The goal is the largest open-source live job dataset on the
internet.** That's a forever project, and there's a clear path to make
it bigger:

- **Add a new ATS scraper** — every ATS we don't cover yet is a few
  thousand companies missing from the dataset. The scraper API is
  intentionally tiny: subclass `BaseScraper`, set `ats`, implement
  `fetch()`. See any file under `src/jobhive/scrapers/` for a 50-line
  reference, and the `Job` model in `src/jobhive/models.py` for the
  schema you populate.
- **Improve coverage on an existing ATS** — many scrapers extract
  description / salary / employment-type only when the ATS surfaces
  them. If you find a tenant where a field is structurally available
  but we're missing it, a one-line PR is welcome.
- **Discover new tenants** — we maintain a
  `{ats}/{ats}_companies.csv` per ATS. New rows = new companies in
  the dataset.
- **Report broken scrapers** — open an issue with the slug and the
  failure mode. ATS APIs drift; flagging a regression early keeps the
  dataset accurate for everyone.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stapply-ai/ats-scrapers
cd ats-scrapers
uv pip install -e ".[dev,scrapers]"
pytest
ruff check .
```

PRs welcome on `main`. CI is green for all 6 of {3.11, 3.12, 3.13} ×
{ubuntu, macos}; please keep it that way.
